Unsupervised Learning and Dimensioality Reduction:

1. The analysis was conducted using Python notebooks.

2. Clustering algorithms along with corresponding neural networks performed in this dedicated notebook.

- Clustering.ipynb

3. Each Dimensionality Reduction algorithm with corresponding clustering and nueral networks has its dedicated notebook.

- PCA.ipynb
- ICA.ipynb
- RandomizedProjections.ipynb
- LassoSelection.ipynb

4. Processed datasets have been placed directly in this repository since their sizes are manageable.

5. To replicate the results presented in the analysis report:

- Open the desired notebook.
- Execute all the cells in sequence.

Thank you for accessing this repository. Kindly refer to the analysis report for a comprehensive understanding of the results.
