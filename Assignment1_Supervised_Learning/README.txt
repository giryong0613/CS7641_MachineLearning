Supervised Learning:

1. The analysis was conducted using Python notebooks.

2. Processed datasets have been placed directly in this repository since their sizes are manageable.

3. Each classification model has its dedicated notebook.

4. Notebooks for each model are named in the following convention: 

- For UFC, "UFC_[model_name]" 
- For Wine, "Wine_[model_name]"

5. To replicate the results presented in the analysis report:

- Open the desired notebook.
- Execute all the cells in sequence.

Thank you for accessing this repository. Kindly refer to the analysis report for a comprehensive understanding of the results.
