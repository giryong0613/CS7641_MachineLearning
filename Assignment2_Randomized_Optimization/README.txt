Randomized Optimization:

1. The analysis was conducted using Python notebooks.

2. Each Optimization Problem has its dedicated notebook.

- FlipFlop.ipynb
- N-Queens-64.ipynb
- Knapsack.ipynb

3. Each Neural Network Optimization has its dedicated notebook.

- NeuralNetwork-RHC.ipynb
- NeuralNetwork-SimulatedAnnealing.ipynb
- NeuralNetwork-GeneticAlg.ipynb

4. Processed datasets have been placed directly in this repository since their sizes are manageable.

5. To replicate the results presented in the analysis report:

- Open the desired notebook.
- Execute all the cells in sequence.

Thank you for accessing this repository. Kindly refer to the analysis report for a comprehensive understanding of the results.
