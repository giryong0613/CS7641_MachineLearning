Markov Decision Processes:

1. The analysis was conducted using Python notebooks.

2. Two MDP problems were explored: Frozen Lake and Forest Management.

2. Frozen Lake analysis perfomred in following two notebooks.

- FrozenLake_Value_Policy_Iteration.ipynb
- FrozenLake_Q_Learning.ipynb

3. Forest Management analysis performed in following two notebook.

- ForestManagement-20state.ipynb
- ForestManagement-500state.ipynb

4. To replicate the results presented in the analysis report:

- Open the desired notebook.
- Execute all the cells in sequence.

Thank you for accessing this repository. Kindly refer to the analysis report for a comprehensive understanding of the results.
